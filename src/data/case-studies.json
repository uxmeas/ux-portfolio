        "challenge": "AKM Secure entered a market dominated by defense contractors like Palantir and Anduril. Their revolutionary cryptographic key management technology was powerful but too complex for non-technical decision makers to understand. They needed to transform their entire digital presence to compete at the enterprise level.",
        "solution": "We conducted rapid user research with 20+ CISOs and security professionals to understand their decision-making process. Then we transformed complex cryptographic concepts into intuitive visualizations, created interactive product demos, and built a responsive platform that works flawlessly across all devices. Every design decision was made to reduce cognitive load while maintaining enterprise-grade sophistication.",
        "impact": "Within 30 days of launch, AKM Secure saw a 400% increase in qualified demo requests. Mobile engagement increased by 85%, with enterprise visitors spending 3x more time exploring the platform. The new design positioned them as a serious competitor in the enterprise security space, leading to meetings with Fortune 500 companies."
