AKM Secure: Transforming the Digital Presence of an OT Cybersecurity Startup

Strategic UX transformation for a cybersecurity startup positioning itself alongside industry leaders like Palantir & Anduril.


THE CHALLENGE
-------------
The Problem:
• Legacy Wix site with inconsistent UX and messaging
• Mobile experience was difficult to navigate and slow to load
• Brand positioning didn't clearly speak to enterprise decision-makers
• Visual design lacked distinction in a crowded cybersecurity market

The Opportunity:
• Present a digital presence that reflects the sophistication of their technology
• Support capital-raising efforts with a credible, investor-ready website
• Stand out visually against better-funded competitors
• Lay the foundation for a scalable, conversion-focused site


MY APPROACH
-----------
Step 1: Competitive Intelligence
Reviewed 15+ cybersecurity leaders including Palantir, Anduril, and CrowdStrike to identify common trust-building patterns, visual standards, and mobile-first practices.

Step 2: Visual Direction
Developed a military-grade, institutional aesthetic with a pure monochromatic palette. Chose Inter typeface, sharp corners, and structured layouts to communicate strength and precision.

Step 3: Conversion Architecture
Designed user flows aimed at enterprise decision-makers with clear hero-to-problem storytelling, prominent trust signals, and multiple CTA entry points.


THE DESIGN SYSTEM
-----------------
Aesthetic Principles:
Pure black and white for high contrast and clarity, with zero-radius corners for a sharp, engineered feel. Function prioritized over decoration.

Typography:
Inter font family across all content. Bold for headlines, semibold for section headers, regular for body text, uppercase for labels.


KEY FEATURES
------------
Homepage Hero:
Applied the 6-second clarity rule with a direct value proposition and visible CTAs for different user intents.

Mobile Experience:
Touch-optimized navigation, thumb-friendly tap zones, and fast load times across devices. Fully responsive testing on 15+ device sizes.


TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------
• Built with Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
• Designed in Figma with a consistent design system
• Achieved fast load performance and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
• Optimized for both keyboard navigation and screen readers


BUSINESS CONTEXT & IMPACT
-------------------------
• Delivered a professional, investor-ready website in 1 week as part of a small startup team (third hire for the project)
• CEO described the redesign as "1000% better than what we had with Wix"
• Website is now being used as a core asset in capital-raising conversations
• Enhanced credibility to help position AKM Secure alongside major industry players


CLIENT TESTIMONIAL
------------------

— CEO, AKM Secure
